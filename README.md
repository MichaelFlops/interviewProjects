> - How did you get into painting?
> - What else do you need to do before you die?
> - Let's look at this piece in particular, at what point does your program that generates this become unpredictable?
> - What programming techniques allow you to make unpredictable output? (just many iterations?)
> - A lot of your alg art looks like either really small things or really large things(cells/galaxies)-what properties of the algorithm generate this?
> - When you are finally happy with the program, when you run it multiple times without chnging the code, how does the art change?
> - are these alg art pieces the bi product of essentially the same code, with different parameters?
> - how/will/can you share your algorithms?
